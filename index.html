    <br><font size = "6">Run from -> Team -> Attack</font>
    <br>Pink, Blue, Orange -> <strong>Red</strong> -> Yellow, Green, Purple
    <br>Blue, Orange, Red -> <strong>Yellow</strong> -> Green, Purple, Pink
    <br>Orange, Red, Yellow -> <strong>Green</strong> -> Purple, Pink, Blue
    <br>Red, Yellow, Green -> <strong>Purple</strong> -> Pink, Blue, Orange
    <br>Yellow, Green, Purple -> <strong>Pink</strong> -> Blue, Orange, Red
    <br>Green, Purple, Pink -> <strong>Blue</strong> -> Orange, Red, Yellow
    <br>Purple, Pink, Blue -> <strong>Orange</strong> -> Red, Yellow, Green
    <br>Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Pink -> <strong>White</strong> -> 
    <br> White is a shy team, will only run away from everybody, and has an extended vision radius
    <br><br> Red runs from Blue, Orange, Pink
    <br> Red attacks Yellow, Green, Purple
    <br> <br> White will start with ten circles
    <br> Every other color will start with six circles
    <br> If a color is tagged by an attacking circle (i.e. Red tags Green) the tagged circle will convert to the attackers team (Green joins Red team)
    <br> The decision of which circle joins which team when collision occurs is decided by the matchup chart
    <br> The larger canvas allows for multiple "chases" to happen at once
